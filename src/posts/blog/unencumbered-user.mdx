summary: An analysis of tech's assumptions concerning accessibility and what can be done to build inclusive products.

Having a partner in sociology, I get a pretty interesting perspective on the current state of
the world. Their focus on food assistance for the past few years during COVID-19 and the surge
in awareness of food insecurity has opened my eyes regarding the barriers that people face accessing food. She published an article about [Barriers to Access: The Unencumbered Client in Private Food Assistance](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/23294965221129572)
that reminded me about how tech and food banks approach problems in similar ways. Both food banks and tech expect that their customers are unencumbered, approaching the service from the ideal situation. However, people's lives are complicated and varied.

> "The unencumbered client has access to ample resources (time, transportation, information, kitchen, etc.) to help them access and best use services while also not experiencing hardships or additional needs (homelessness, lack of transportation, disabilities and health issues, etc.) that lead to barriers accessing and using services."

In food banks, organizations assume clients are unencumbered. The unencumbered client can travel to a food bank in their car. They have access to a kitchen
so they're able to cook rice or other uncooked products they may be given. They can wait in line for long periods because the food at the beginning of distribution is better or has more options. They have someone to watch their children while they wait for distribution. They have a fridge where they can store the items they're given.

This unencumbered client conflicts with the reality of the situation of people needing the resources of a food bank. Software development has similar problems where sites are built making assumptions for how people access products.

## Assumptions of the unencumbered user in tech

The unencumbered user can read small text and see light blue links on a slightly darker blue background.
They can click small buttons with pinpoint precision. They are completely attentive and are devoting their full
attention to the task at hand. Any audio or visual used in the product is completely understood the first time.
They always have high-speed internet connections and the latest Macbook Pro. They are fluent in the native language
of the company.

## Accessibility Assumptions and MVP

Tech has always gravitated towards a method of thinking like Agile where rapid development and
deployment of software features are prioritized. While the approach has many benefits, like the ability
to experiment and push new features rapidly, it can result in developers rushing to release new features without taking the time to ensure that they are accessible.

A culture of "move fast and break things" prioritizes growth and innovation, but it creates a sense of
urgency where developers need to meet deadlines or OKRs which leads to shortcuts. Designing food bank programs or software that expects customers to be unencumbered, originates from a lack of diversity in organizations as explained by [Joan Acker](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27640904) who originally developed the concept to describe how assumptions of unencumbered workers create gendered and racial disparities in workplaces.

Adrian Roselli wrote an article called [Accessibility 'Gaps' in MVPs](https://adrianroselli.com/2022/11/accessibility-gaps-in-mvps.html) describing how major companies that perpetuate a message of inclusiveness and accessibility still push new features in public beta or behind feature flags that have bad contrast or aren't keyboard friendly.

> "If your MVP does not have accessibility factored in, it is not viable. If you claim accessibility is a core principle but your version 0 does not include it, then it is not a core principle."

While companies will speak about a culture of accessibility and inclusiveness, these attributes aren't
truly valued in an environment where speed and growth are prioritized over creating products accessible to all users.
Technical achievements are celebrated and bonus features like designs with animations or easter eggs are shared and copied, but the [plethora of contrast issues are ignored](https://twitter.com/norablindsided/status/1280251316044886016).

## Embracing Inclusiveness for All Users

We tend to focus on the aspect of accessibility that creates inclusive products for people who use screen readers or have color blindness. Companies may dismiss these concerns claiming they're "just in beta" or "don't have any users like that." It's vital to think about accessibility about breaking down _all_ barriers that our product may have. Presenting accessibility as a value to all users makes it easier to integrate into an organization.

> Accessibility is about good design.

Throughout this series, we'll delve into various types of barriers that might exist in our products. While we will cover familiar accessibility topics like color contrast, we'll also explore less-discussed areas such as data requirements or timed interviews that may exclude individuals with anxiety.

Additionally, we'll discuss how to incorporate accessibility into our core thinking through the use of personas and user stories, integrating it into our design and development processes.
