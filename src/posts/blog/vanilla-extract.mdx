In 2021, Mark Dalgleish released a follow-up to similar concepts he introduced in CSS Modules.
With CSS Modules, a developer can write their styles [co-located to their code](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation), and also have class names generated to avoid conflict with the rest of the stylesheet. While this loses the benefits of [dynamic CSS-based design](http://www.csszengarden.com/), it does allow for larger teams to not have to worry about conflicting styles cascading and overwriting them.

## An improvement to CSS Modules

Enter TypeScript. Now developers can reduce the number of bugs they introduce by strongly typing their JavaScript application by catching typos.

This went over really well in the JS community and this blog is written using TypeScript, but
when it came to our styles, we were writing css using template literals, or css modules.

```tsx
// button.tsx
import { styles } from 'styled-components';

// typo: it's color :(
const button = styles.button`
    colour: blue;
`;
```

```css
/* button.module.css */

.button {
  /* another typo */
  colour: blue;
}
```

## TypeScript is testing

While our component code, our state logic, functions, were all getting checked
for static errors, our CSS was sitting...waiting...hoping. That one day we wouldn't
have to visually refresh to make sure the right color was getting applied.

## Enter Vanilla-Extract

Vanilla-Extract does one minor thing to css modules that ends up being a _huge_ change.

It adds a .ts to the end of the css file.

Okay, maybe a few more things. But this is huge. I can write

## Using Vanilla-Extract to define design tokens

## It works everywhere!
