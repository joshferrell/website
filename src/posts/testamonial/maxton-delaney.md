I have been lucky enough to work with Josh for several years and in all our experience together, Josh has played a critical role
given his architectural capabilities and his ‘get stuff done’
attitude.

Outside of his technical prowess, Josh is all around a great person
with strong communication skills and empathy for his peers. Josh is
a 10x engineer and it’s with high regard that I recommend him.
