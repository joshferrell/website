I have been lucky enough to work with Josh for several years at
companies ranging from early stage startup environments to large
scale technical organizations.

In all our experience together, Josh has played a critical role
given his architectural capabilities and his ‘get stuff done’
attitude.

Outside of his technical prowess, Josh is all around a great person
with strong communication skills and empathy for his peers. Josh is
a 10x engineer and it’s with high regard that I recommend him.
